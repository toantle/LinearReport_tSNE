# LinearReport_tSNE
Code for analysing the t-SNE algorithm. As required by Linear Algebra course.

The python notebook contains all code for illustrating t-SNE and it's applications.

tsne.py contains the implementation of t-SNE (with consulting from the implementation of Sklearn)

tsne_old.py contains the original implementation of the author, which doesn't work really well
